# retroflexDataCollection
 
This is a project that seeks to collect cross-linguistic data on the pronunciation of retroflexes, labials and dentals and form clusteres out of them to find out how these phonetic catagories comapre with each other across different languages.

The experiment is served by a JATOS server.

The __dataCollection.html__ file contains the code for the experiment.
